# My-portfolio

This website is a showcase of my skills in web development, focusing on how to build a fully functional web application using only **HTTP** and **CSS**. I love working with creative designs and unique styles, which is why you'll find a lot of animations throughout the site. This project is meant to demonstrate my ability to create engaging, visually appealing web pages without relying on JavaScript frameworks or libraries.

## Features

- **Fully Responsive Design**: The website adjusts beautifully across devices of different screen sizes.
- **Creative Animations**: A wide range of CSS-based animations that add an interactive and dynamic feel to the site.
- **Minimalist Approach**: Using only HTML and CSS to create a lightweight, fast, and efficient web application.



## Design Philosophy

I love creating unique, creative designs and paying attention to styling details. The goal of this website is not just to be functional but to showcase the power of CSS in delivering visually appealing and interactive content without JavaScript. I have carefully crafted each animation to enhance the user experience and make the design stand out.

## Animations

The animations are implemented entirely through **CSS**, giving the site a dynamic feel without needing complex scripting. Some of the animations include:

- **Hover Effects**: Buttons and images respond to hover states with smooth transitions.
- **Page Transitions**: **CSS** is used to create seamless transitions between sections of the site.
- **Loading Animations**: Creative loading animations to keep users engaged while content is fetched.
